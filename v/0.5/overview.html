<p> The Digital Construction Building Material Ontology (DICM) explicitly defines the necessary
relationships between building elements, constructions’ details, materials and their properties. As
such, it aims to provide information related to construction details, materials, properties, values
and units.  </p>

<p> Information about building materials is one of the important aspects to manage a building
holistically and in a sustainable way over all phases of its building life cycle. The assignment of
material specifications to building elements and sharing these details between stakeholders involved
in a project is a decisive task. It will influence the project largely. These properties associated
with different layers of building elements are necessary to perform energy, acoustic, lighting,
etc. simulations at different stages of the project. Development and analysis of engineering models
of a building from its early stages onwards enable performance evaluations and support informed
design choices and decisions based on optimization. Seamless data transfer from the BIM model to
analytical models considerably increases the efficiency and reduces the inconsistencies, efforts,
and time in collaboration scenarios. However, challenges in data sharing activities are persistent
in the current workflow for the conversion of BIM models to analytical models. Hence, the DICM
ontology was developed to represent construction and material models of building elements and to
improve interoperability. The concepts considered in the DICM ontology are represented in the figure
below.  </p>

<p>
The ontology as illustrated in the following figure contains the major
classes which are <tt>dicm:Material</tt>, <tt>dicm:MaterialObjectStructure</tt>,
<tt>dicm:MaterialProperty</tt>, <tt>dicv:BuildingObject</tt>,
<tt>dicv:QuantitativeProperty</tt>. Which also have major object properties,
those are <tt>dicm:hasMaterial</tt>, <tt>dicm:hasLayer</tt>, <tt>dicm:hasLayerSet</tt>,
<tt>dicm:hasAdjacentElementLayer</tt>, <tt>dicm:hasAdjacentLayer</tt>,
<tt>dicm:adjacentElement</tt> and <tt>dicv:isPropertyFor</tt>. Data properties for
material data are also defined.

The class dice:BuildingObject is an entity that forms a part of an existing or designed
building. This class have subclass related to the material object structure. The
<tt>dicm:MaterialObjectStructure</tt> is a concept to represent material related information that has
material related properties. The classes <tt>dicm:Layer</tt>, <tt>dicm:LayerSet</tt>, <tt>dicm:Profile</tt>, <tt>dicm:ProfileSet</tt>
are the subclasses of <tt>dicm:MaterialObjectStructure</tt>. However, the primary focus is on <tt>dicm:Layer</tt>, and
<tt>dicm:LayerSet</tt>. The <tt>dicm:Layer</tt> is a single and identifiable part of an element which is constructed
of a number of layers (one or more) (ISO, 2018). The <tt>dicm:LayerSet</tt> is a designation by which
materials of an element constructed of a number of material layers is known and through which the
relative positioning of individual layers can be expressed (ISO, 2018).
</p>

<p> The class dice:MaterialEntity is equivalent to the BFO class 'material entity'. It has two
subclasses. One is <tt>dicm:MaterialBatch</tt>, which is defined as a collection of homogeneous physical
substance that participates in the construction project as the input of a process. Second concept is
<tt>dicm:Material</tt>, which is used to represents homogeneous or inhomogeneous substance that can be used
to form elements. It depicts the material assigned to a product. The <tt>dicm:Material</tt> has 4 subclasses,
they are <tt>dicm:CompositeMaterial</tt>, <tt>dicm:InorganicNonMetallicMaterial</tt>, <tt>dicm:MetallicMaterial</tt>,
<tt>dicm:OrganicMaterial</tt>. <tt>dicm:MetallicMaterial</tt> is to represents the metals which are crystalline and
has a structure consists of crystals and grains. Example individuals of this material type are
steel or cast iron. <tt>dicm:OrganicMaterial</tt> is used to define the organic materials such as wood,
polymer, or bitumen. <tt>dicm:CompositeMaterial</tt> represents the constituent materials like
concrete, masonry, or reinforced concrete. <tt>dicm:InorganicNonMetallicMaterial</tt> defines the
material types such as glass, or natural stones.  </p>

<p>
The <tt>dicv:QuantitativeProperty</tt> is a class that can assume quantitative values. The concept
<tt>dicm:MaterialProperty</tt> subclass of <tt>dicv:QunatitativeProperty</tt> and is used to represents the different
properties of materialThe <tt>dicm:MaterialProperty</tt> have 9 subclasses, which represents different kinds
of material properties. These material properties listed as follow.
</p>

<ul>

  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialChemicalProperty</tt> – the chemical properties of materials:
   acidity concentration, alkalinity concentration, etc. </li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialCombustionProperty</tt> – the material properties generated due to material
  combustion: CO content,  N2O content, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialEnergyProperty</tt> – the energy properties of 
  materials: olar refraction index, gas pressure, visible refraction index.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialFuelProperty</tt> – the fuel properties of the material: carbon content,
  lower heating value, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialHygroscopicProperty</tt> – the hygroscopic properties of the material:
  moisture diffusivity, vapour permeability, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialMechanicalProperty</tt> – the mechanical properties of 
  materials: young modulus, shear modulus, poisson ratio, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialOpticalProperty</tt> – the optical properties: visible transmittance, solar
  transmittance, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialPhysicalProperty</tt> – the physical properties of materials: 
  density, porosity, molecular weight, etc.</li>
  
  <li><tt>dicm:MaterialThermalProperty</tt> – the thermal properties of materials: specific heat,
  boiling point, freezing point, etc.</li>
  
</ul>
